Write an application that manages a number of cities
Each city has a unique name (string), a county (string) and a population (integer).
The application will have a menu-driven user interface and will provide the following features:

    1. Add a city
        - adds the city with the given id, county and population to the list.
        - error if giving the existing name, the name, county are empty or population is negative

    2. Delete a city
        - deletes the city with the given name from the list
        - error if non-existing name is provided

    3. Show all cities
        - shows all cities in descending order of their population

    4. Show cities whose population is > than given one, ordered in descending order of population

    5. exit
        - exit the program

    Observations:
        - Add 10 random cities at program startup
        - Create a list-based and a dict-based representation of the City entity
        - Write specifications for non-UI functions
        - Write tests for the non-trivial, non-UI functions
        - Use TypeError and ValueError to handle input and program errors
        - Each function does one thing only, and communicates via parameters and return value
        - The program reports errors to the user. It must also report errors from non-UI functions!
        - Make sure you understand the city's representation
        - Try to reuse functions across functionalities (Less code to write and test)
        - Don't use global variables!
