"""
Write an application that manages a group of students.
Each student has a unique id (string), a name (string) and a grade (integer).
The application will have a menu-driven user interface and will provide the following features:

    1. Add a student
        - adds the student with the given id, name and grade to the list.
        - error if giving existing id, the name or grade fields not given or
        empty

    2. Delete a student
        - deletes the student with the given id from the list
        - error if non-existing id given

    3. Show all students
        - shows all students in descending order of their grade

    4. Show students whose grade is > than given one, ordered in descending order of grade

    5. exit
        - exit the program

    Observations:
        - Add 10 random students at program startup
        - Create a list-based and a dict-based representation of the Student entity
        - Write specifications for non-UI functions
        - Write tests for the non-trivial, non-UI functions
        - Use TypeError and ValueError to handle input and program errors
        - Each function does one thing only, and communicates via parameters and return value
        - The program reports errors to the user. It must also report errors from non-UI functions!
        - Make sure you understand the student's representation
        - Try to reuse functions across functionalities (Less code to write and test)
        - Don't use global variables!
